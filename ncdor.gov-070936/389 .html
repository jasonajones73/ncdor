<p>North Carolina families with qualifying children who were 16 or younger at the end of 2019 who <strong>did not </strong>already receive the $335 check from the NC Department of Revenue. </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Qualifying individuals who were not required to file a 2019 state tax return and have NOT already received the $335 grant</strong></li>

<h3>Full Eligibility Requirements </h3>

The grant amount is $335.00 total for each eligible individual, even if the individual has two or more qualifying children.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Qualifying Individuals Who Did Not File a 2019 Individual Income Tax Return.</strong> If you did not file a 2019 North Carolina Individual Income Tax Return, Form D-400, solely because your federal gross income (and your spouse’s federal gross income, if applicable) for 2019 did not exceed the State’s filing requirement for your filing status for 2019 (generally $10,000 per year if you are single and $20,000 per year if you are married), you may be eligible to receive an Extra Credit Grant payment under the extended program if you meet all of the conditions of the program and you apply for the grant on or before July 1, 2021. <strong>Note:</strong> You can apply for the grant under the extended program even if you previously applied for the grant, but you did not receive the grant because the Department determined that you were ineligible to receive the grant.</li>
<li><strong>Qualifying Individuals Who Filed a 2019 Individual Income Tax Return.</strong> If you filed a 2019 North Carolina Individual Income Tax Return, Form D-400, on or before October 15, 2020, you may be eligible to receive an Extra Credit Grant payment under the extended program if you meet all of the conditions of the program and you perform one of the following actions on or before July 1, 2021:
<ol>
<li>File Form NC-1105.

<li>File an amended <a href="/documents/2019-d-400-individual-income-tax-return">2019 Form D-400</a> and correct one or more of the conditions that caused you to be ineligible for the automatic grant. (For information on eligibility conditions, see “Eligibility Conditions Required to Receive an Automatic Grant Award,” below. For information on how to file an amended Form D-400, see the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2b93843a-a806-4003-80d3-249e5992b122" href="/documents/2019-d-401-individual-income-tax-instructions" title="2019 D-401 Individual Income Tax Instructions ">instructions for filing Form D-400</a> for tax year 2019 available from the Department’s website.)</li>

<p>(b) Report at least one qualifying child on Line 10a of Form D-400 for calendar year 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Qualifying Child:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In order to be eligible for the grant, your child had to be a “qualifying child” for purposes of the federal child tax credit for tax year 2019. In general, a child qualifies you for the federal child tax credit if the child meets all of the following conditions:</li>
<li>The child is your son, daughter, stepchild, eligible foster child, brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, half-brother, half-sister, or a descendant of any of them (for example, your grandchild, niece, or nephew).</li>

<h3>What is the extra credit grant?</h3>
<p>The extra credit grant is a $335 payment to you from the State of North Carolina. If you qualify, you will receive a $335 payment.</p>
<p>The payment is to help families with qualifying children in North Carolina by providing economic support to assist with virtual schooling and child-care costs during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>The application period for the Extra Credit Grant applications closed on July 1, 2021. The Department has issued all checks to eligible individuals. If you have not yet received a check or denial letter, please contact the Department at 1-877-252-4983.</strong></p>
<h3>What are the eligibility requirements for the Extra Credit Grant Program?</h3>
<p>The following individuals with a qualifying child who was 16 or younger at the end of 2019 who have not already received the grant payment from the NC Department of Revenue may be eligible to receive the grant:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you did not file a 2019 North Carolina Individual Income Tax Return, Form D-400, solely because your federal gross income (and your spouse’s federal gross income, if applicable) for 2019 did not exceed the State’s filing requirement for your filing status for 2019 (as printed on page 1, Part 2 of Form NC-1105), you may be eligible to receive an Extra Credit Grant payment under the extended Program if you meet all of the conditions of the Program and you apply for the grant using Form NC-1105 on or before July 1, 2021.</li>
<li>If you filed a 2019 North Carolina Individual Income Tax Return, Form D-400, on or before October 15, 2020, you may be eligible to receive an Extra Credit Grant payment under the extended Program if you meet all of the conditions of the Program and you perform one of the following actions on or before July 1, 2021:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>File Form NC-1105 and complete Parts 1 and 3 of the application. You can <strong>ONLY </strong>complete Part 3 of Form NC-1105, if did not previously receive an automatic grant award because you did not report a qualifying child on line 10a of your timely filed 2019 Form D-400.</li>
<li>File an amended 2019 Form D-400 and correct one or more of the conditions that caused you to be ineligible for the automatic grant. Specifically, you must  meet both of the following conditions:
<ul>
<li>Report on Form D-400 for calendar year 2019 that either you or, if filing a joint return, your spouse, was a resident of North Carolina for the entire 2019 calendar year.</li>
<li>Report at least one qualifying child on Line 10a of Form D-400 for calendar year 2019.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The application period for the Extra Credit Grant applications closed on July 1, 2021. The Department has issued all checks to eligible individuals. If you have not yet received a check or denial letter, please contact the Department at 1-877-252-4983.</strong></p>
<h3>I was not a North Carolina resident for the entire 2019 calendar year. Do I qualify for the grant?</h3>
<p>No. If you were not a resident of North Carolina for all of calendar year 2019, you do not qualify for the grant unless you are married, and your spouse was a resident of North Carolina for all of calendar year 2019, and you filed a joint 2019 North Carolina individual income tax return on or before October 15, 2020.</p>
<h3>I filed my 2019 North Carolina individual income tax return after October 15, 2020. Can I still qualify for the grant?</h3>
<p>In order to be eligible for the grant, individuals subject to North Carolina income tax for tax year 2019 were required to file a State tax return on or before October 15, 2020.</p>
<h3>How do I determine if my child is a qualifying child?</h3>
<p>In order to be eligible for the grant, your child had to be a “qualifying child” for purposes of the federal child tax credit for tax year 2019. In general, a child qualifies you for the federal child tax credit if the child meets all of the following conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The child is your son, daughter, stepchild, eligible foster child, brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, half-brother, half-sister, or a descendant of any of them (for example, your grandchild, niece, or nephew).</li>
<li>The child was under age 17 at the end of 2019.</li>
<li>The child did not provide over half of his or her own support for 2019.</li>
<li>The child lived with you for more than half of 2019.</li>
<li>The child is claimed as a dependent on your 2019 federal tax return.</li>
<li>The child does not file a joint 2019 federal tax return.</li>
<li>The child was a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, or U.S. resident alien.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information, see Internal Revenue Code Section 24 or federal Publication 972, Child tax Credit and Credit for Other Dependent. The Internal Revenue Service also provides an Interactive Tax Assistant tool “<a href="https://www.irs.gov/help/ita/does-my-childdependent-qualify-for-the-child-tax-credit-or-the-credit-for-other-dependents" target="_blank">Is My Child a Qualifying Child for the Child Tax Credit?</a>” This interactive tool may help you determine if your child is a qualifying child for purposes of the federal child tax credit for tax year 2019</p>
<h3>Does my child have to be a certain age in order for me to be eligible to receive the grant?</h3>
<p>Yes. To qualify for the grant, a child must be under the age of 17 (16 or younger) at the end of 2019.</p>
<h3>I am eligible for the grant. How much will I receive?</h3>
<p>If you are eligible for the grant, you will receive a one-time payment of $335.</p>
<h3>I am eligible for the grant. I have two qualifying children. Will I receive $335 for each qualifying child?</h3>
<p>No. The grant amount is $335 per eligible individual, not for each qualifying child.  The Department of Revenue does not control the amount of the grants.  The law provides the grant amount of $335 per eligible individual, even if the eligible individual has two or more qualifying children. </p>
<h3>I did not receive a North Carolina child deduction on my 2019 North Carolina individual income tax return because my 2019 gross income exceeded the State’s threshold for my filing status. Do I qualify for the grant?</h3>
<p>It depends. You will qualify to receive the grant if you meet all of the eligibility requirements, including the requirement that you must be allowed a federal child tax credit for calendar year 2019. If you did not receive a federal child tax credit for calendar year 2019 because the federal tax credit was eliminated under federal law, you are not eligible for the grant. For federal tax purposes, the 2019 federal child tax credit is reduced when a taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds $400,000 for individuals who file a joint tax return with their spouse, and $200,000 for all other filing statuses.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p972.pdf" target="_blank">federal Publication 972, Child Tax Credit and Credit for Other Dependents.</a></p>
<h3>I am divorced. Am I eligible to receive the grant?</h3>
<p>This determination is based on federal law. In addition to meeting other eligibility requirements, generally, your child must be claimed by the “custodial parent” which is the parent with whom the child lived for the longer period of time during the year. However, the custodial parent may execute Federal Form 8332 which states that the custodial parent will not claim such credit and the noncustodial parent can attach the form and claim the child. Whichever parent or guardian has the authority to claim the child on their federal income tax return will have the authority to claim the child on the state income tax return and would be able to receive the grant.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p972.pdf" target="_blank">federal Publication 972, Child Tax Credit and Credit for Other Dependents.</a></p>
<h3>I previously filed my 2019 North Carolina individual income tax return and I reported my filing status as “married filing separately.” Do I qualify for the grant?</h3>
<p>You will qualify for the grant if you meet all of the eligibility requirements.</p>
<h3>I filed my 2019 North Carolina individual income tax return and I reported my filing status as “married filing jointly.” Will my spouse and I each receive a grant?</h3>
<p>No. For purposes of eligibility for the grant, spouses who filed a joint 2019 North Carolina individual income tax return are treated as one eligible individual.</p>
<h3>My only source of income for tax year 2019 was social security.  The amount of social security benefit I received is greater than the threshold amount for my filing status for tax year 2019 as reflected on the table printed on the application (Form NC-1105). Am I eligible for the grant?</h3>
<p>It depends. Federal gross income means all income you received in the form of money, goods, property, and services that isn’t exempt from tax.</p>
<p>In general, if your Social Security benefit is your only source of income, then Social Security benefits are not considered federal taxable income. For more information, contact a tax professional or see Publication 17, Tax Guide for Tax Year 2019, available on the Internal Revenue Service website.</p>
<h3>I filed my 2019 North Carolina individual income tax return.  I did not report a qualifying child on Line 10a, even though I had a qualifying children for whom I was allowed a federal child tax credit on my 2019 federal return. Am I eligible to receive the grant payment?</h3>
<p>Yes, you are still eligible.  To receive the grant payment you must complete one of the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete Part 1 and Part 3 of Form NC-1105, Application for Extra Credit Grant Program (NC-1105) or;</li>
<li>Have a POA or Paid Tax Preparer complete  Part 1 and Part 3 of Form NC-1105,  Application for Extra Credit Grant Program (NC-1105) or;</li>
<li>File an amended 2019 State individual income tax return, correcting line 10a</li>
</ul>
<p>Whichever option you choose, the application or the amended return must be completed and submitted to the Department on or before July 1, 2021.</p>
<h3>I filed my 2019 North Carolina individual income tax return.  I did not report a qualifying child on Line 10a, even though I had a qualify child for whom I was allowed a federal child tax credit on my 2019 return.  I plan to amend my 2019 D-400 to report a qualifying child.  How do I complete an amended return to receive the grant payment?</h3>
<p>You do have the option to complete the Application for Extra Credit Grant Program (NC-1105) instead of filing an amended return (see above FAQ).  However, to amend your return to change line 10a, you must follow the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete an amended <a href="/documents/2019-d-400-individual-income-tax-return">2019 Form D-400</a>, along with the required <a href="/documents/2019-d-400am-north-carolina-amended-schedule">Form D-400 Schedule AM.</a></li>
<li>On Form D-400, make the necessary changes to the original Form D-400 by showing the corrected number of qualifying children on Line 10a.</li>
<li>On Form D-400 Schedule AM, fill in the “Other” circle as the reason for amending your tax return and write in “Extra Credit Grant Program” as the detailed explanation for the change.</li>
<li>Provide a copy of your 2019 federal tax return and any accompanying federal form or statement that supports the changes made to Line 10a on Form D-400. The supporting documentation must include the name, age, and social security number of each qualifying child for whom you were allowed a federal child tax credit for tax year 2019.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you file the amended return by mail, write “Extra Credit Grant Program” at the top, right hand corner of the <a href="/documents/2019-d-400-individual-income-tax-return">2019 Form D-400</a>. The amended return and any accompanying documents must be postmarked on or before July 1, 2021.</p>
<p>For detailed information on how to file an amended 2019 individual income tax return, see <a href="/documents/2019-d-401-individual-income-tax-instructions">Form D-401</a>, North Carolina Individual Income Tax Instructions for Tax Year 2019.<span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif"> </span></span></span></p>
<h3>I filed a 2019 State tax return on or before October 15, 2020. I, and my spouse, were residents of NC for the entire 2019 calendar year. I had a qualifying child that I reported on line 10a. I didn’t receive a grant payment.  Why didn’t I receive a payment when it looks like I qualified for one? <span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif"><b><span style="font-size:13.5pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;&amp;quot&quot;,serif"><span style="color:#092940"> </span></span></span></b></span></span></span></h3>
<p>Check the State tax return you filed for calendar year 2019 to see if you indicated on the return that you, and your spouse, were residents of North Carolina for the entire year.  In addition, check to see if the number of qualifying children you reported on line 10a was greater than zero. </p>
<p>If you did not indicate that you, or your spouse if filing a joint return, were full-time NC residents, you must file an amended 2019 Form D-400 to correct the information.  If you reported zero on line 10a but had at least one qualifying child for whom you were allowed a federal tax credit in 2019, then you may either amend your 2019 D-400 to correct the information, or you may apply for the grant using Form NC-1105. <em>(See the instructions for Form NC-1105 for further assistance.)</em></p>
<h3>My spouse is active duty military. Are there special rules for determining if I am a resident of North Carolina?</h3>
<p>Yes. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act provides that a spouse shall neither lose nor acquire domicile or residence in a state when the spouse is present in the state solely to be with the servicemember in compliance with the servicemember’s military orders if the residence or domicile is the same for both the servicemember and the spouse. For additional information see the Department’s website.</p>
<h3>My spouse is active duty military.  I am in North Carolina solely to be with my service member spouse.  We have two qualifying children under the age of 17.  Although my spouse and I lived in North Carolina for the entire calendar year 2019, neither my spouse nor I were residents of North Carolina.  During 2019, I worked in North Carolina, but I did not file a 2019 North Carolina individual income tax return because my income was not subject to North Carolina tax under the Veterans Benefits and Transition Act of 2018.  Am I eligible to receive the child grant?</h3>
<p>No. In order to be eligible for the child grant, an individual who applies for the child grant must be a resident of North Carolina for the entire 2019 calendar year.</p>
<h3>My spouse is active duty military.  My spouse and I lived in North Carolina for the entire calendar year 2019.  We have two qualifying children under the age of 17.  Although my spouse was not a resident of North Carolina in 2019, I was a resident of North Carolina for the entire calendar year 2019.  I did not file a 2019 North Carolina individual income tax return solely because my gross income for 2019 did not exceed the State’s filing requirement for my filing status.  Am I eligible to receive the child grant?</h3>
<p>Yes.</p>

<h2><a id="Section_4" name="Section_4"></a>Section IV: Information for the Extra Credit Grant Program Extension</h2>
<h3>Is this a new grant program?  Can I complete an application and get another grant payment?</h3>
<p>No. Under <a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/Sessions/2021/Bills/Senate/PDF/S172v5.pdf" target="_blank">legislation</a> signed into law May 24, 2021, individuals who missed the original deadline may be eligible to receive the $335 grant payment.  Importantly, individuals who have already received the grant payment DO NOT qualify for additional grant payment. <strong>The application period for the Extra Credit Grant applications closed on July 1, 2021. The Department has issued all checks to eligible individuals. If you have not yet received a check or denial letter, please contact the Department at 1-877-252-4983.</strong></p>
<h3>Who is eligible to receive the grant payment under the extended Extra Credit Grant Program?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Qualifying individuals who were not required to file a 2019 state tax return and have not already received the $335 grant.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Individuals who did not file a 2019 state tax return solely because the individual’s federal gross income for the 2019 taxable year did not exceed the <a href="/taxes-forms/individual-income-tax/individual-income-filing-requirements">state’s filing requirements</a> for the individual’s filing status for tax year 2019, and who missed the Program’s original deadline. </p>

<h3>Will I owe the Internal Revenue Service tax on the grant?</h3>
<p>Whether the grant is included in federal gross income is determined under federal law. Generally, however, all income is taxable for federal tax purposes unless specifically exempted by federal law.</p>
<h3>Will the grant be included in my North Carolina taxable income?</h3>
<p>No. The grant is not subject to North Carolina individual income tax. In calculating North Carolina taxable income, you may deduct the amount of the grant if the grant is included in federal adjusted gross income. Please review for the 2020 Individual Income Tax Instructions, <a href="/documents/2019-d-401-individual-income-tax-instructions">Form D-401</a>, for further guidance.</p>
<h3>I do not want to fill out an application or amend my 2019 State return to receive the grant payment.  Can I take a deduction on my 2020 State return? </h3>
<p>No. You cannot deduct the amount of the grant payment on your 2019 State income tax return instead of filing an application or amending your 2019 State return. The grant payment is not a refund of State tax.</p>
<h3>What is the difference between the North Carolina grant and the stimulus check I received from the federal government?</h3>
<p>The Extra Credit Grant Program is a State program administered by the Department of Revenue. The purpose of the grant is to help families with qualifying children in North Carolina by providing economic support to assist with virtual schooling and child-care costs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Economic Impact Payment was a federal program administered by the Internal Revenue Service on behalf of the US government. The federal stimulus check is a refund of federal income tax.  The state grant check is not a refund of state income tax.</p>
<h3>My spouse is deceased. Am I eligible to receive the grant?</h3>
<p>If you meet all of the eligibility requirements, you will receive a grant even if your spouse is deceased.</p>
<h3>Will an individual who is now deceased who had a qualifying child qualify receive the grant?</h3>
<p>An individual that meets all of the eligibility requirements will receive a grant even if the individual died prior to the issuance of the grant.</p>
<h3>I am an enrolled member of a federally recognized Indian tribe. I have a qualifying child. Am I eligible to receive the grant?</h3>
<p>It depends. You will qualify to receive the grant if you meet all of the eligibility requirements.</p>
<h3>Why did I receive a letter stating my application for the grant was denied?</h3>
<p>The Department determined that you were not eligible to receive the grant payment.  You were not eligible for the grant payment because you failed to meet at least one of the following requirements:</p>
<p>1. You did not complete the application in its entirety.</p>
<p>2. You did not meet all of the eligibility conditions necessary to receive the grant.</p>
<p>The denial letter provides the reason you were denied a grant payment.</p>
<h3 style="list-style-type: none;">What if I submitted my application or amended return for the grant, but have not received a check or denial letter from the Department?</h3>
<p>The Department has issued all checks to eligible individuals. Anyone who does not qualify will receive a letter from the Department. If you have not yet received a check or denial letter, please contact the Department at 1-877-252-4983.</p>
